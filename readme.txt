Shamir's Secret Sharing
Shamir's Secret Sharing is an algorithm in cryptography created by Adi Shamir. It is a form of secret sharing, where a
secret is divided into parts, giving each participant its own unique part, where some of the parts or all of them are needed in order to reconstruct
the secret.Counting on all participants to combine the secret might be impractical, and therefore sometimes the threshold scheme is
used where any {\displaystyle k} k of the parts are sufficient to reconstruct the original secret.

Secret sharing (also called secret splitting) refers to methods for distributing a secret amongst a group of participants, each of whom is allocated a share of the secret. The secret can be reconstructed only when a sufficient number, of possibly different types, of shares are combined together; individual shares are of no use on their own.
